# tables 0.9.17

It didn't fix the issue; some of the example results in \donttest sections
were autoprinting as browsable HTML.

# tables 0.9.16

This version doesn't call browseURL() non-interactively
even in a \donttest section.  Hopefully this will deal with the
"calibre" files.

# tables 0.9.15

This is a relatively minor update, adding a few functions.  The
reason to send it is that it is used in the R Tables Working Group
project.
