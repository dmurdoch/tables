\code{Hline()} is not very flexible:  it must be the leftmost header in a row specification
for the table, i.e. \code{mean * Hline()} is not allowed.  Anything to the right of the
\code{Hline()} factor will be ignored.
}
\value{
Produces an expression to insert a label which will be interpreted by LaTeX as a request
for a horizontal line.
